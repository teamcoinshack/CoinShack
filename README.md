## Project Scope
CoinShack - A risk-free simulator for anyone to learn to trade!

Want to learn how to trade cryptocurrency but overwhelmed with paragraphs of jargons online? Want to gain some practical experience in cryptocurrency trading but you’re afraid of the risks involved? Or do you simply want to trade but don’t have the money and capital to do so? 

Fret not! With CoinShack, anyone — literally anyone, can start trading! Receive free virtual currency and start trading with real-time market data for numerous cryptocurrencies without any risk involved! 


## Problem Motivation
Cryptocurrency and blockchain have been the trendiest up and coming technology for quite a while now and I believe many of us have always wanted to learn how they work. Unfortunately, most online resources only provide the mundane theoretical aspects regarding this area, making cryptocurrency a field of mystery to many. Furthermore, there aren't many platforms which allow people to try their hands at cryptocurrency trading; there aren't opportunities for beginners to experience the market forces real time without using their own real money. Therefore, we came up with our app which promises a risk-free experience for anyone to learn how to trade and invest in cryptocurrency and at the same time, gain more knowledge in this field.
